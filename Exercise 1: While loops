# Question 1 Solution
# There are many ways to solve this problem! Here is one:
num = 2
while num < 11:
    print(num)
    num += 2
print("Goodbye!")

# Here is another:
num = 2
while num <= 10:
    print(num)
    num += 2
print("Goodbye!")

# And another:
num = 0
while True:
    num += 2
    print(num)
    if num >= 10:
        print("Goodbye!")
        break

# And one more:
num = 1
while num <= 10:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)
    num += 1
print("Goodbye!")

# Question 2 Solution
# There are always many ways to solve a programming problem. Here is one:
print("Hello!")
num = 10
while num > 0:
    print(num)
    num -= 2

# Here is another:
num = 11
print("Hello!")
while num > 1:
    num -= 1
    if num %2 == 0:
        print(num)
        
'''Question 3: Write a while loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. 
end is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result: 
21
which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.

For problems such as these, do not include input statements or define variables we will provide for you. 
Our automating testing will provide values so write your code in the following box assuming these variables are already defined.
'''
# Solution
total = 0
while end > 0:
    total += end
    end -= 1
print(total)

# Here is also one of a few ways to solve this problem:
total = 0
current = 1
while current <= end:
    total += current
    current += 1
print(total)
